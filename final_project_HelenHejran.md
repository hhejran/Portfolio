## Summary
This is a story about the rise of streaming services and its effect on the entertainment industry - films and television specifically. With the rise of streaming services, companies have increased in their use of vertical integration.
As a reader, I want viewers to be able to freely consume all the most popular shows, so that people are able to consume the art that is being created.
I can do this by pushing for laws or agreements that don't allow entertainment companies to continue their vertical monopolies. 

Setup: Streaming platforms experience a dramatic increase as entertainment companies start to set up internal streaming channels.
Conflict: The market has now become dominated by a select few streaming services and they all use vertical integration. To make matters worse, corporations have stopped making deals between subsidiary companies and competitors in order to benefit their own streaming platforms.
Resolution: Push for legislation or agreements between entertainment unions and the major corporations to ensure stop the vertical monopolies (or find a comprable solution).

## Data
I have included data sources as well as some of the research sources that outline streaming services throughout the years. There are write ups about the different sites and the current list of streaming services will help setup my story. I then will then focus on the data from Statista and IMDB Pro to look at how streaming services are nowadays. I am unsure how effective this will be, but I may want to focus on a prime example like Disney+ or Peacock and track the way they have taken back their content from competitors as well as shifting their focus on their own streaming platforms. I am considering doing a "case study" type of example with Marvel TV and Netflix to demonstrate a real life example and problem.

## Method and medium
Throughout the initial process, I will make revisions to what my story is and allow the data to reshape my story as I look more closely at it. Along with further looking into my data, I will see if there is additional data that I am missing and need to find to make my story complete and do further research on what has already been written regarding streaming services. I will make any revisions as necessary to my story and then start a storyboard to see how the story flows. Do I need to make it more complex or simplify it? 
Then I will start sketching out my wireframes by hand. I find it easiest to draw it out with my pens and color pencils. Then, I will show my wireframes to a few friends and classmates to get their feedback. I'll ask what works, what doesn't work, what they think my main message is and see if they can figure out what the story is meant to be. Then, I'll make more revisions to my wireframes before starting to try and produce my data visualizations. 
I expect to make my final visualizations and story through Tableau and Shorthand. I am not knowledgable of either of these programs, so I will do my best to allow myself extra time as I try and figure out what is going on. I will see how transferrable my wireframes are into my actual visualizations and add my data visualizations to Shorthand. I will add the visualizations and add in the written content. I will show my Shorthand to a few friends to get their opinions before the final presentation.
