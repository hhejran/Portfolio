# Final Project Part One
## Summary
This is a story about the rise of streaming services and its effect on the entertainment industry - films and television specifically. With the rise of streaming services, companies have increased in their use of vertical integration.
As a reader, I want viewers to be able to freely consume all the most popular shows, so that people are able to consume the art that is being created.
I can do this by pushing for laws or agreements that don't allow entertainment companies to continue their vertical monopolies. 

Setup: Streaming platforms experience a dramatic increase as entertainment companies start to set up internal streaming channels.
