## Reflection

There were several changes I implemented between part two and part three of my final project. I needed to add more substance to my overall story in order to have a clearer call to action.

I added a word cloud showing major shows and movies removed from Netflix as major studios started developing their streaming services. I also created the chart of new original content based on existing IP as I had suggested doing in part two. To show the importance of this information, I found and added the main drivers for adding subscriptions - a large library and exclusive original content. Having data to show that these are the top drivers in consumer motivations helped justify why I was pointing out the earlier information. 

I felt it was important to then look at what drives consumers to cancel subscriptions and saw money and the conclusion of the content they wanted to watch were the main factors. This tied in with Netflix's increasing prices over the past five years. Looking at the information I had presented, I noticed that it is interesting that what is going on with Netflix is in line with what drives consumers to cancel their subscriptions. Netflix has been doing well throughout the pandemic because they are the top streaming service. However, as I had pointed out in my initial chart, the market is hitting oversaturation now. As the competitors continue to grow and attract viewers, Netflix needs to make sure they don't make misteps that will cost subscribers. On the flip side, the new services need to continue to garner more subscribers and focus on capturing a larger audience.

I adjusted two chart ideas from part two. I remade my first chart from the alluvial chart to a simple side by side comparison with logos. I wanted the reader to look at the chart and understand that we have gone from very few to a huge number of streaming services. I had tried to play around with another type of chart that could easily get the point across, but the simple side by side of logos was the most direct and easiest way. I asked some fellow MEIM classmates to look at the changed graphic and they agreed it was much easier to understand than the initial chart I had prepared in part two. In my line chart, I had originally shown the prices since 2010, but there were essentially no changes until 2015, so it was suggested I shorten the years shown in the graph since I want to emphasize the time period when there were changes in prices. I chose to start in 2014 just to show that in 2014 HBO Now had not been fully launched.

While I did use Flourish, I also ended up using Infogram and even Canva to help design some of my charts and tables. There were times I wanted to make certain edits and struggled to find out how to do it. I felt Infogram was actually a pretty good site for me because it allowed me to add more edits and customization. When it came to my logo chart of 2007 vs 2021, I really just wanted to design it on Adobe Illustrator, but unfortunately don't have it this semester. When it came to organizing my presentation on Shorthand I felt I came to similar roadblocks as I did when designing my charts. There were times when I knew what I wanted to happen, but didn't know how to make it happen. I don't know html or css, so I couldn't just code it onto my Shorthand. There were also times when I wanted to add in an embbed link to my chart, but wasn't able to do that so I was forced download and add it as an image.

Overall, I realized my presentation has a greater focus for those working in streaming services, but I was able to also present a suggestion to subscribers since they may be interested to understand the field. One of the great things about streaming services when they first rose to prominence was that it was a vastly cheaper alternative to cable. More and more people are "cutting the cord" but with these changes in streaming services and the increased divide, this is leading to the new version of cable. For my presentation I decided to focus on the audience of people within the entertainment industry because I felt putting in both audiences with their vastly different call to actions would be too much for a two minute presentation.
