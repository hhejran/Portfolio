# About Me
Hi! My name is **Helen Hejran** (she/her). I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley in California before obtaining my Bachelor's degree at UC San Diego with a major in Biology and minors in Theatre and Health Care-Social Issues. In January 2020, I completed UCLAâ€™s Management Development for Entrepreneurs (MDE) Program. Working with an MBA student mentor, I wrote a Business Improvement Plan, which aimed to improve the company and remedy growing pains. I am now a first year Master of Entertainment Industry Management Student at CMU. For the spring semester, I am a Creative Development Intern with Threshold Entertainment.

I am interested in pursing a career in Television or Film upon graduation. Currently, I am most interested in exploring Development and Production. 

I am excited to be taking Telling Stories With Data! The other electives I opted for in the spring semester are Project Management, Disruptive Technologies in Arts Enterprises, Guest Experience in Theme Park Design, and Introduction to Writing for Television.

# What I Hope To Learn
I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of programs and data visualization. While I do not have experience with the programs that will be utilized in this course, I have made graphs and charts on Excel, PowerPoint, and Canva; and I learned R in Statistics with R.  I have also learned the Adobe Suite (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Audition, AfterEffects, Premiere Pro, Rush, XD). I am really looking forward to learning and using Tableau and other programs (like Github!) in Telling Stories With Data.

Furthermore, I hope to learn more about effective ways to visualize data in easily comprehendable ways. Recently, I have thought more about how data is shown to the public and how easy it is to misinterpret or mislead the public. It is incredibly important to not only understand how to properly analyze the data presented, but also how to most effectively present information to the public in the most effective way.
