This is my Telling Stories With Data Portfolio.

# About Me
Hi! My name is Helen Hejran (she/her). I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley in California before obtaining my Bachelor's degree at UC San Diego. In January 2020, I completed UCLAâ€™s Management Development for Entrepreneurs (MDE) Program. I am now a first year Master of Entertainment Industry Management Student at CMU. As a MEIM student, I am interested in pursing a career in Television or Film upon graduation. Currently, I am most interested in exploring Development and Production. For the spring semester, I am a Creative Development Intern with Threshold Entertainment. 

I am excited to be taking Telling Stories with Data! The other electives I opted for in the spring semester are Project Management, Disruptive Technologies in Arts Enterprises, Guest Experience in Theme Park Design, and Introduction to Writing for Television.

# What I Hope To Learn
I hope to learn more about effective ways to visualize data in easily comprehendable ways. The extent of my coding and data visualization experiences is limited. I have made graphs and charts on Excel, PowerPoint, and Canva and I learned R in Statistics with R. With my limited background, I am really looking forward to learning and using Tableau and other programs (like Github!)
