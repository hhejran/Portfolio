# Final Project Part Two
## Wireframes and Storyboards
The growth of streaming services available has massively grown. Studios that used to license their films and television shows have created their own major streaming service sites.

We will focus on the major studios with new and relaunched streaming services that are now competing with the three original major sites.
Paramount+, HBO MAX, Disney+, and Peacock
vs.
Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video

They have taken back their IP and have used old, beloved IP to launch reboots and spinoffs.
Friends, The Office, Parks and Recreation left Netflix (for HBO Max and Peacock).
Debuting on these streaming services include the Friends Reunion, Sex and the City revival, Fraiser revival and more.

At the same time, these giants have increased their prices.

What will the future hold?
The divide will continue and prices will increase. This is the new cable.
The big corporations own so much IP, so it is important that there is still freedom for their subsidiary production companies to have the freedom to shop around the new shows and films.
If prices continue to dramatically increase there will hit a saturation and the market will have to evolve.
Subscribers can avoid overpaying by simply splitting all the services in larger and larger groups.
To combat this, the streaming services either need to control their price increases or create bundles.

## User Research and Interviews
### Interview Questions
Is the story clear?
What worked well? What didn't work?
Is every chart easy to understand?
Do you find the story and flow engaging?
Does the call to action make sense to you?
Any further comments?

### Feedback
##### Interview #1:
1. Trouble understanding the first graph. Found it super confusing, particularly due to the interactive element that makes it all seem connected in a way that it is not connected. "..it would be good to label the the left is 2007 and the right is 2020, and then remove the interactive elements so you don't get that highlighting thing happening. I almost wonder if it needs to be as simple as a logo cloud"
2."One compelling thing to add to yours is to show where the consumer is at now."
3. For the price change graph, "clarify who is "They" that have taken back their IP so like maybe "These new players have taken off their old IP and then as a result of the increased competition, the older more-established stalwarts are now increasing their prices.""

##### Interview #2:
1. The story right now many be too short
2. The first graph is good but needs to be clarified about the years and how it is 3 streaming sites at first going into many.
3. Be mindful for the last graph to color match with the companies (i.e. Disney blue, Netflix Red)
4. The ending is a good summary and closes out the story well, but "I think you are missing a call to action" 

##### Interview #3:
1. The first chart is cool but becomes difficult to read when scrolling through it all. Again the interactive element from Flourish may be doing more harm than anything.
2. For the first chart, do you want to list the other companies/services more clearly?

#### Interview #4:
1. Overall, it is good and the story arc is clear.
2. Some confusion on the first graph. Could you add more year to year elements?

### Review

One big challenge is it is harder to find and parse through the information to add hard number driven information about vertical integration and so I am unsure if I can. I tried to work around it by instead using examples of key IP the organizations are using, but I am unsure if it is effective enough. There are also some cases that show potential legal issues with vertical integration, but adding that to the story was difficult. During the in-class discussions, the group was much more drawn to me bringing up the price changes and that effect and less so to vertical integration aspects, but this may just be due to them being focused in different fields.

The first graph needs to be reworked. The interactive default from Flourish makes it more confusing. I also know I don't want those numbers there, and need to figure out how to get rid of it. I need to add more labels to clarify what is going on.

I need to figure out a good list visualization if I am going to do that instead of trying to get the vertical integration data to work. 

This is still quite the work in progress.
