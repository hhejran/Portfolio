# Final Project Part Two
## Wireframes and Storyboards
The growth of streaming services available has massively grown. Studios that used to license their films and television shows have created their own major streaming service sites.

We will focus on the major studios with new and relaunched streaming services that are now competing with the three original major sites.
Paramount+, HBO MAX, Disney+, and Peacock
vs.
Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video

They have taken back their IP and have used old, beloved IP to launch reboots and spinoffs.
Friends, The Office, Parks and Recreation left Netflix (for HBO Max and Peacock).
Debuting on these streaming services include the Friends Reunion, Sex and the City revival, Fraiser revival, Saved by the Bell reboot, Punky Brewster revival and more.

At the same time, these giants have increased their prices.

What will the future hold?
The divide will continue and prices will increase. This is the new cable.
The big corporations own so much IP, so it is important that there is still freedom for their subsidiary production companies to have the freedom to shop around the new shows and films.
If prices continue to dramatically increase there will hit a saturation and the market will have to evolve.
Subscribers can avoid overpaying by simply splitting all the services in larger and larger groups.
To combat this, the streaming services either need to control their price increases or create bundles.
