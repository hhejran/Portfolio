We will focus on the major studios with new and relaunched streaming services that are now competing with the three original major sites.
Paramount+, HBO MAX, Disney+, and Peacock
vs.
Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video

They have taken back their IP and have used old, beloved IP to launch reboots and spinoffs

At the same time, these giants have increased their prices.

What will the future hold?
