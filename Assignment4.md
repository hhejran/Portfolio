## Explaining Your Process
The overall process of doing this with a little complicated. At first, I was just looking at these graphs in trying to figure out how I could bridge them all together. Eventually, I realised it's okay that I can't do  race, geography, COVID-19 cases, and vaccination all together. It was just too much, I didn't even have all the data I would need to properly convey information, especially geography wise.
Then I was looking at what worked and what didn't work, and I felt the heart of the article was about race despite the fact that they used maps and talked location. It was supposed to highlight race, so I wanted to focus on race and COVID-19. I felt that it was important to look at COVID-19 case rate against the vaccination rate because it will be able to display whether groups that are dispproportionatly getting COVID-19 are being targeted on getting the vaccination to combat it.
If you see that a certain population is getting COVID-19 a lot more, then are they also getting vaccinations at least an equal rate to other groups?
There were also points where there wasn't available data for all groups, so I had to exclude mixed race and other. At first, I played around with making different charts and trying to think what if I'm changing the data that we're showing then I need to play around and see specifically what is the most affective. I started making charts and then brainstormed again on what kind of graphs I could use. I came up with a couple that I felt would work, but the the lollipop type chart one which I had seen in the LA Times seemed the best. I realised it might be the most effective type of chart and I just need to change the data they were looking at. I ended up changing the data used by focusing on the race groups. I tried to do percentage of each group, but my information was incomplete and wasn't making sense so I stuck with data compiled on the public health website.


## Wireframes and User Feedback

I got feedback from 3 different people and I showed them my wireframes and they were great about looking through all of them. I had three that I didn't think would work and they agreed.
Of the three I felt didn't work, the people giving me feedback agreed .I feel that was a little boring and everyone was really drawn to the line with a 2. said that line with 2 dots and really helps make it clear that your you know your comparing these things your looking at the races on and so that was something I was drawn towards when person Talk to was saying how the the people that I drew were maybe a nice one cause it helps humanise him and you know you could you could make them each 1 represent a raise him but it was brought up to me that like stacking them like that might be a little confusing and people might not understand like how the 2 things related to each other especially since they are the same type of image into the might just like confused on how related they are Which I understood waz going to be a problem I ultimately decided to follow the idea that in a go for simple simplest better on and in so I went with the 2 dots on one line.
