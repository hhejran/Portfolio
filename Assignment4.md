## Explaining Your Process
The overall process of doing this with a little complicated. At first, I was just looking at these graphs in trying to figure out how I could bridge them all together. Eventually, I realised it's okay that I can't do  race, geography, COVID-19 cases, and vaccination all together. It was just too much, I didn't even have all the data I would need to properly convey information, especially geography wise.
Then I was looking at what worked and what didn't work, and I felt the heart of the article was about race despite the fact that they used maps and talked location. It was supposed to highlight race, so I wanted to focus on race and COVID-19. I felt that it was important to look at COVID-19 case rate against the vaccination rate because it will be able to display whether groups that are dispproportionatly getting COVID-19 are being targeted on getting the vaccination to combat it.
If you concede that a certain population is getting covered a lot more are they also getting vaccinations at least an equal rate to other groups or are these groups the ones who need the most are they gonna be the ones who are actually Left Behind and if they are then this is a real problem that we need a highlight because let's say Like a group is it really getting back needed at the fastest rate but they also are say the least likely to get coated at least on just breaking it down by Reyes then you can say OK this is a problem cause we want everyone to be getting it but they aren't the the group that is getting code the most it might not be the biggest concern where as if there is another group that is as we can have heard at least in LA area we heart like latinos have been getting covert a lot but there not getting vaccinations and this is a real problem cuz there not gonna stop getting covert and these vaccinations are gonna slowly start to build-up OK community kind of A And that was also a challenge honestly I was looking on the state in some of its missing some Ivey's specifically for over 35 on it wasn't completely consistent all the way across-the-board and in fact like there are points where like OK I don't have data on certain groups just cause it isn't available for whatever reason the I think its reference as in accuracies in so inaccurate estimates they don't put any anything at all in so that I jist 1st played around with making different charts and trying to see OK what if I'm changing the data that were really showing than I need to play around and see specifically what is the most effective and so I just started making charts and at 1st I was on just looking at The population as a whole and just saying OK what percentage of this pop of the whole population are that are getting vaccinations how many of them are Asian or why or black or Latino but then I realised that this might not be the most effective method because if there's one population that is 50% then there naturally gonna be a greater percentage and so I realise it's actually more important to see OK what is the percentage of that population within the race and so knowing that I had to do that that was something I start to him brainstorm again on what kind of graphs I could use custom charts they just aren't effective like via can't do a stack chart if it's going to be each percentage is out of a 100 independent of each other and so that To pose a problem that I didn't want to do like 10 different charts suddenly moved on and him start to play around with a how can I convey Mike about 5 different groups of people and I want to talk about to percentages that aren't exactly complimentary to each other on the greater the vaccination percentage the better the greater the covert rate percentage the worst in so that was another issue that I came into warlike I don't want people to now have association of like O vaccination percentages higher supposed to think good but then you see cove percentages hiv have to think bad and so there were certain graphs and charts that I was playing around with that I felt on Me that harder to make clear on another problem I came up with woz the fact that I also don't want people to think you add them together like I don't want people to think that at you should be adding these 2 things together so so yet overall there are a lot of challenges on how to breast present this data and I honestly I came up with a couple that I felt would work him but the the lollipop chart one which I had seen in the LA Times I realise you know what this might be the most effective way but do with different data do with different data stack up together that wave in venue can actually compare in so Mostly ended up changing the data used and creating more groups in so there were more I'm lines and then I try to think about which I really struggle with I try to think about colour cuz the blue and green I am not sure why they chose that and so I try to really think about OK what colour do I want to choose what is that going to mean 


## Wireframes and User Feedback

I got feedback from 3 different people and I showed them my wireframes and they were great about looking through all of them. I had three that I didn't think would work and they agreed.
Of the three I felt didn't work, the people giving me feedback agreed .I feel that was a little boring and everyone was really drawn to the line with a 2. said that line with 2 dots and really helps make it clear that your you know your comparing these things your looking at the races on and so that was something I was drawn towards when person Talk to was saying how the the people that I drew were maybe a nice one cause it helps humanise him and you know you could you could make them each 1 represent a raise him but it was brought up to me that like stacking them like that might be a little confusing and people might not understand like how the 2 things related to each other especially since they are the same type of image into the might just like confused on how related they are Which I understood waz going to be a problem I ultimately decided to follow the idea that in a go for simple simplest better on and in so I went with the 2 dots on one line.
