## Compare and Contrast
Each chart shares a slightly different message. The bar chart looks at a static point in time. It allows you to compare the GDP across countries, but only for 1 year. The Grid of Line Charts and the Line Chart allow a more holistic view. These two charts look at a range of years. The bar chart and the grid of line charts allowed for one color to be used throughout. My problem with the Grid of Line Charts is that there are so many charts to look at and it becomes hard to compare the countries. The scaling is consistent throughout the charts but there are simply too many and makes comparisons much more difficult.It also requries the viewer to dart their eyes across the pages over and over.
In the case of the Line Chart, there are so many countries in one image that it becomes necessary to use multiple colors. It was rather difficult to make it meaningful in one chart without it all becoming a blur, so I tried to group the countries into similiar shades by their region. That still felt incredibly cluttered, so I decided to focuse on the countries at the top in 2019. This ended up being JPN and GRC at the top. I decided to then add BEL in red, since they were at the top in 1995 and I wanted to see where they ended up in 2019. Looking at these three countries, I then added a final country, EST in orange. I had noticed BEL didn't drop that much in the subsequent years and while they were no longer on top they also weren't on the bottom! This made me wonder if my hunch that the bottom country was always towards the bottom was correct. Adding in the fourth country helps show that while growth is possible and dropping is also possible, dramatic changes to shoot to the top or bottom over decades isn't happening.
