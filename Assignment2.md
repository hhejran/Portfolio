## Compare and Contrast
Each chart shares a slightly different message. The bar chart looks at a static point in time. It allows you to compare the GDP across countries, but only for 1 year. The Grid of Line Charts and the Line Chart allow a more holistic view. These two charts look at a range of years.
The bar chart and the grid of line charts allowed for one color to be used throughout. In the case of the Line Chart, there are so many countries in one image that it becomes necessary to use multiple colors. It was rather difficult to make it meaningful in one chart without it all becoming a blur, so I tried to group the countries into similiar shades by their region. I think with so much information, it perhaps would be more useful if tehre was a singular or maybe two or three maximum to highlight and allow all the rest to fall into the background.
